        <p>
            Wait a minute, I said wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's <br>
            nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture That's not what I had in <br>
            mine. The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't exicte me at all. There is just no <br>
            character to anything here. It had a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need <br>
            something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.
